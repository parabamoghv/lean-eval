# `e8_irrep_tensor_square_decomp`

Existence of a 779247-dim irreducible e₈-representation with 40 tensor-square isotypic components

- Problem ID: `e8_irrep_tensor_square_decomp`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: e₈ is the largest exceptional Lie algebra (dim 248), defined here by the Serre construction (Mathlib's `LieAlgebra.e₈`). The formal statement is existential: it asks for some 779247-dimensional irreducible representation whose tensor square has 40 isotypic components. In the intended solution, one constructs such a witness using the highest-weight representation with highest weight ω₁ + ω₈ (the sum of the first and last fundamental weights, in Bourbaki labelling). The U(g)-module structure on V ⊗ V used in the statement comes from lifting the Lie action via the universal enveloping algebra.

- Informal solution: Construct V as V(ω₁+ω₈), the unique 779247-dim irrep of e₈. Tensor square (LiE-verified) has 40 distinct simple summand isomorphism classes (155 components with multiplicity), with the smallest being the trivial 1-dim, the 248-dim adjoint (mult 2), the 3875-dim V(ω₁), and so on up to the 85,424,220,000-dim summand. This is used to produce the existential witness required by the formal statement.
