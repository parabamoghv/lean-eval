# Jacobians in algebraic geometry

Christian Merten's algebraic-geometry analogue of Kevin Buzzard's Jacobian
challenge, posted to leanprover Zulip:
<https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/583336-Autoformalization/topic/Jacobian%20challenge/near/587802685>.

In the following, by a smooth curve we mean a geometrically irreducible, smooth scheme of relative
dimension one over a field.

## Main missing definitions

* `AlgebraicGeometry.JacobianChallenge.genus` -- genus of a proper, smooth curve
* `AlgebraicGeometry.JacobianChallenge.Jacobian` -- the Jacobian of a proper, smooth curve
* `AlgebraicGeometry.JacobianChallenge.Jacobian.ofCurve` -- the Abel-Jacobi map from a proper smooth
  curve to its Jacobian

## Main missing theorems

* `Jacobian.smoothOfRelativeDimension_genus` -- The Jacobian of a proper, smooth curve `C` is smooth
  of relative dimension `g`, where `g` is the genus of `C`.
* `Jacobian.exists_unique_ofCurve_comp` -- the universal property of the Jacobian of a proper,
  smooth curve.

The universal property of the Jacobian variety: For any abelian variety `A`,
any morphism `f : C ⟶ A` such that `f(P) = 0` factors uniquely through the
Jacobian of `C`.
In other words, `Jacobian C` is the Albanese variety of `C`.
