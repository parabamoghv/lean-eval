# `g2_irrep_tensor_square_decomp`

Existence of a 64-dim irreducible g₂-representation with 14 tensor-square isotypic components

- Problem ID: `g2_irrep_tensor_square_decomp`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: g₂ is the smallest exceptional Lie algebra, defined here by the Serre construction (Mathlib's `LieAlgebra.g₂`). The formal statement is existential: it asks for some 64-dimensional irreducible representation whose tensor square has 14 isotypic components. In the intended solution, one constructs such a witness using the highest-weight representation with highest weight ω₁ + ω₂ (the sum of the two fundamental weights). The U(g)-module structure on V ⊗ V used in the statement comes from lifting the Lie action via the universal enveloping algebra.

- Informal solution: Construct V as the irreducible 64-dim representation V(ω₁+ω₂). Decomposition (LiE-verified): V⊗V = V(0,0) + V(1,0) + 2V(0,1) + 2V(2,0) + 2V(1,1) + 2V(0,2) + 3V(3,0) + 3V(2,1) + V(1,2) + V(0,3) + 2V(4,0) + 2V(3,1) + V(2,2) + V(5,0). This is used to produce the existential witness required by the formal statement.
