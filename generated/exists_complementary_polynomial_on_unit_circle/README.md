# `exists_complementary_polynomial_on_unit_circle`

Complementary polynomial on the unit circle

- Problem ID: `exists_complementary_polynomial_on_unit_circle`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: If a complex polynomial has modulus at most 1 on the unit circle, then there is a same-degree complementary polynomial whose squared moduli add to 1 on the circle.
- Source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-025-05302-9
- Informal solution: Construct a polynomial Q so that |P(z)|^2 + |Q(z)|^2 = 1 for all z on the unit circle.
