Rouché's theorem (zero-count formulation, extended to the meromorphic case via divisors),
stated as equality of multiplicity-counted zero counts on the closed disk of radius `R`
centered at `0`.

The previous formulation used `ValueDistribution.logCounting f 0 R`, the **log-weighted**
Nevanlinna counting function — which is *not* the conclusion of Rouché. Under `‖g‖ < ‖f‖`
on the boundary, `f` and `f + g` have the same number of zeros (counted with multiplicity)
inside the disk, but the log-weighted count depends on where each zero sits. Concretely,
`f(z) = z` and `g(z) = -1/2` satisfy `|g| = 1/2 < 2 = |z| = |f|` on `|z| = 2`, yet
`logCounting f 0 2 = log 2` while `logCounting (f + g) 0 2 = log(2 / (1/2)) = log 4`.

We instead state the conclusion as the equality of the multiplicity sums of the zero
divisors of `f` and `f + g` taken on the closed disk of radius `R`.
