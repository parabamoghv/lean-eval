# Fatou–Julia / Cantor dichotomy

For the quadratic family `T_c(z) = z² + c`, the filled Julia set
`K_c = { z ∈ ℂ | T_c^n(z) stays bounded }` satisfies:

- `c ∈ M` (Mandelbrot set) implies `K_c` is connected;
- `c ∉ M` implies `K_c` is homeomorphic to the Cantor space `ℕ → Bool`.

For quadratic polynomials, the usual Julia set is `∂K_c`. The submitted
statement uses the filled Julia set `K_c`; this is equivalent for the
dichotomy here, since connectedness of `K_c` is equivalent to
connectedness of `∂K_c`, and in the escaping case `K_c = ∂K_c` is a
Cantor set.
