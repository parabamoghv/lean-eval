# Nash equilibrium existence theorem

§33 of Oliver Knill's *Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics*. Every
finite `n`-player game in mixed strategies admits at least one Nash
equilibrium.

Nash gave two proofs: the 1950 one uses Brouwer's fixed-point theorem; the
1951 one uses Kakutani's set-valued generalization.

mathlib has `stdSimplex ℝ S` (the natural model of a mixed strategy) and the
standard finite-sum/product machinery, but **no game theory at all** —
there is no `Mathlib/GameTheory/` module, and `grep -ri nash`,
`mixed.strategy`, `best.response` returns nothing relevant. No formalization
of Nash equilibrium existence was found in any major proof assistant.

probability distribution on `S`: a non-negative function summing to `1`. -/

pure strategy from their own set. -/

/-- The **expected payoff** to a player with payoff function `u` when each
player `j` plays the mixed strategy `σ j`. Sum over all pure-strategy
profiles, weighted by the product of marginal probabilities. -/

/-- A profile of mixed strategies `σ` is a **Nash equilibrium** for the
payoff functions `u₀, …, uₙ₋₁` if (i) each `σ i` is a probability
distribution on `S i`, and (ii) no player `i` can strictly improve their
expected payoff by switching to a different mixed strategy `τ`, holding the
other players' strategies fixed. -/
