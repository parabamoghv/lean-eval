/-- Implementation of `lake exe lean-eval validate-manifest`. Loads the
manifest (which already enforces id/holes/duplication rules) and cross-checks
against the `@[eval_problem]` inventory built from source.

The Python original also called `gp.validate_hole_shape`, a textual pre-check
for typos in hole names. That check is purely redundant with the inventory
cross-check (which goes through the elaborator), so it is dropped here. -/
